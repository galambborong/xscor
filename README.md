# XSCOR

## Aims

The aims of this project are twofold: 

- To establish a suitable method for parsing binary data from SCORE files
- To establish a method for *editing* this data in such a way that it can be reopened in SCORE

## Longer-term plans

Once the above has been achieved, the plan is to create a series of modules with specific editing/formatting objectives. The most obvious of these is writing a program to intelligently edit Code 5 items (slurs/ties).
